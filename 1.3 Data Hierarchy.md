# Data Hierarchy

## Bits
The smallest data item in a computer can assume the value 0 or the value 1. It's called a bit (short for "binary digit")..
The impressive functions performed by computers involve only the simplest manipulations of 0s and 1s. (Examining a bit's value, setting a bit's value and reversing a bit's value.)

## Characters
Digits, letters and special symbols are known as **characters**.
### Character set
**Character set** is the set of all the characters used to write programs and represent data items.
A computer's character set represents evry character as a pattern of 1s and 0s.

C supports various character sets (including Unicode).

## Fields
**Fiels** are composed of characters or bytes.

## Records
Several related fields can be used to compose a **record**. A record is a group of related fields.

## Files
A **file** is a group of related records. [Note: More generally, a file contains arbitrary data in arbitrary formats.]

## Database
A **database** is a collection of data organized for easy access and manipulation.
The most popular model is the *relatioal database*,, in which data is stored in simple *tables*.
### Table
A **table** includes *records* and *fields*. 
We can *search, sort* and otherwise manipulate the data based on its relationship to multiple tables or databases. 

## Bit Data
The amount of data being produced worldwide is enormous and growing quickly.
Big data applications deal with massive amounts of datas and this field is growing quickly, creating lots of opportunity for software developers.
Unit Bytes Which is approximately
 1 kilobyte (KB) 1024 bytes 103 (1024 bytes exactly)
 1 megabyte (MB) 1024 kilobytes 106 (1,000,000 bytes)
 1 gigabyte (GB) 1024 megabytes 109 (1,000,000,000 bytes)
 1 terabyte (TB) 1024 gigabytes 1012 (1,000,000,000,000 bytes)
 1 petabyte (PB) 1024 terabytes 1015 (1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)
 1 exabyte (EB) 1024 petabytes 1018 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)
 1 zettabyte (ZB) 1024 exabytes 1021 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)
